🏔️ 65 Python Pyramid Patterns
A collection of 65 different Python pyramid, triangle, and pattern-printing programs, ranging from beginner-friendly designs to advanced pattern logic.
This repository is made to help learners understand loops, nested loops, pattern logic, and Python fundamentals through visual output.

📌 About This Repository
This project includes 65 Python programs that print different types of pyramid and pattern shapes using:

for loops

while loops

Nested loops

String formatting

Center alignment

Mathematical patterns

The patterns include:

Star pyramids

Number pyramids

Alphabet pyramids

Inverted shapes

Hollow patterns

Diamond shapes

Pascal-style patterns

Advanced creative patterns

Each program is written in simple and understandable code, with clear structure and direct output.

Every Python file contains one pattern program with clear naming.

▶️ How to Run
To run any pyramid program:

python pyramid1.py
or

python3 pyramid1.py
No external libraries are required.

⭐ Example Pattern (Direct Code)
Here is one sample pyramid included in this repo:

Simple Star Pyramid
rows = 5
for i in range(1, rows + 1):
    print(" " * (rows - i) + "* " * i)
Output:

    *
   * *
  * * *
 * * * *
* * * * *
